a completely unneeded implementation of a taskbar-like element in pure javascript

ran into this problem when working on my [Ludum Dare 29](https://github.com/Thristhart/ld48-29) game and figured I'd solve the problem correctly after the competition was over

turns out this can be done much better with flexboxes instead, so do that if this is something you need
